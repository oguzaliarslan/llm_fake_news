Week 5-6 (1 Nov - 8 Nov): Literature Review
Oğuz Ali Arslan: 
* Read a survey on Data Mining perspective about Fake News Detection
* Read another survey that focuses on implemention of Fake News Detection model

Doruk Üzgün:
* Read a survey that includes different deep learning approaches on Fake News Detection.
* Added the datasets

Week 6-7 (9 Nov - 15 Nov): EDA and Data Preparation
Oğuz Ali Arslan:
* Cleaned the data (removed stopwords, punctuations, non-unicode chars) and added some plots.
* Changed the overall structure of the ipynb and created two different dataset, one for combined binary classification and other for multi-label classification

Doruk Üzgün:
* Loaded the datasets and explored them.
* Preprocessed our datasets and combined them into a one and made them suitable for NLP preprocessing steps

Week 8-9 (20 Nov - 28 Nov): LLM and NON-NN ML
Oğuz Ali Arslan:
* Decided to drop one of the datasets since after inspecting the datasets, LIAR dataset have very different characteristics (much shorter).
* Created the LLM (LLaMa2) pipeline and get the partial results.
* Created the BERT pipeline and still working on it since it creates some overfitting problem.
