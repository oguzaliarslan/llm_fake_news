Week 5-6 (1 Nov - 8 Nov): Literature Review
Oğuz Ali Arslan: 
* Read a survey on Data Mining perspective about Fake News Detection
* Read another survey that focuses on implemention of Fake News Detection model

Doruk Üzgün:
* Read a survey that includes different deep learning approaches on Fake News Detection.
* Added the datasets

Week 6-7 (9 Nov - 15 Nov): EDA and Data Preparation
Oğuz Ali Arslan:
* Cleaned the data (removed stopwords, punctuations, non-unicode chars) and added some plots.
* Changed the overall structure of the ipynb and created two different dataset, one for combined binary classification and other for multi-label classification

Doruk Üzgün:
* Loaded the datasets and explored them.
* Preprocessed our datasets and combined them into a one and made them suitable for NLP preprocessing steps

Week 8-9 (20 Nov - 28 Nov): LLM and NON-NN ML
Oğuz Ali Arslan:
* Decided to drop one of the datasets since after inspecting the datasets, LIAR dataset have very different characteristics (much shorter).
* Created the LLM (LLaMa2) pipeline and get the partial results.
* Created the BERT pipeline and still working on it since it creates some overfitting problem.

Doruk Üzgün:
* Created the LSTM pipeline and got the initial results.

Week 9-10 (28 Nov - 4 Dec): Intermediate Report
Oğuz Ali Arslan:
* Worked on the Intermediate Report.

Doruk Üzgün:
* Worked on the Intermediate Report.

Week 10-11 (5 Dec - 13 Dec):
Oğuz Ali Arslan:
* Split the datasets into bits to train our models on them seperately.

Doruk Üzgün:
* Created the ML gridsearch pipeline.
Week 11-12 (14 Dec - 21 Dec):
Oğuz Ali Arslan:
* Changed the BERT and LLM pipeline into py scripts to have a better file structure.
* Executed the classifiers.

Doruk Üzgün:
* Run the models on local to get the scores.
Week 12-13 (21 Dec - 28 Dec):
Week 13-14 (28 Dec - 1 Jan):
Oğuz Ali Arslan:
* Decided to use Mistral as secondary LLM to show it as PoC.
* Trained DistilBert on our datasets to obtain the results.
