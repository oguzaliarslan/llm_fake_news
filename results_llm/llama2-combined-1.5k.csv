""Dieser Flüchtling ist nur ein kleiner Vorgeschmack auf das, der EU droht, wenn sie weiterhin mit dem Gedanken spielt, die Beitrittsgespräche mit der Türkei abzubrechen"", erklärte Erdogan heute auf einer Pressekonferenz. ""Wo der herkam, gibt's noch mehr. Jetzt kann jeder sehen, dass ich es ernst meine."" Der Bürgerkriegsflüchtling aus Syrien befindet sich derzeit einem kleinen Ruderboot zwischen der türkischen Küste und der griechischen Insel Kalymnos und kommt laut griechischer Küstenwache direkt auf die EU zu. Beobachter fürchten, dass er frühestens im Januar Mitteleuropa erreichen und die dortige Zivilbevölkerung und Politik Angst und Schrecken versetzen wird. Die EU berät derzeit, wie auf den Warnflüchtling zu reagieren ist. Während einige Experten raten, umgehend einzulenken, fordern viele Hardliner, schnell wie möglich einen EU-Flüchtling die Gegenrichtung zu schicken. ssi, dan; Foto: Shutterstock",1, Real

Ms. Bramblette basic question: much weigh? doctor’s scale went 350 pounds, heavier that. know number, would know diet working? doctor answer. Ms. Bramblette, 39, lived Ohio time, resorted solution made burn shame. drove nearby junkyard scale could weigh her. 502 pounds. One three Americans obese, rate steadily growing two decades, health care system — attitudes, equipment common practices — ill prepared, practitioners often unwilling, treat rising population fat patients. difficulties range scales scanners, like M. R. I. machines built big enough heavy people, surgeons categorically refuse give knee hip replacements obese, drug doses calibrated obese patients. situation particularly thorny 15 million Americans extreme obesity — body mass index 40 higher — face wide range health concerns. Part problem, patients doctors say, reluctance look beyond fat person’s weight. Patty Nece, 58, Alexandria, Va. went orthopedist hip aching. lost nearly 70 pounds and, although still way go, feeling good herself. saw doctor. “He came door exam room, started tell symptoms,” Ms. Nece said. “He said: ‘Let cut chase. need lose weight. ’” doctor, said, never examined her. made diagnosis, “obesity pain,” relayed internist. fact, later learned, progressive scoliosis, condition caused obesity. Dr. Louis J. Aronne, obesity specialist Weill Cornell Medicine, helped found American Board Obesity Medicine address sort issue. goal help doctors learn treat obesity serve resource patients seeking doctors look past weight medical problem. Dr. Aronne says patients recount stories like Ms. Nece’s time. “Our patients say: ‘Nobody ever treated like serious problem. blow tell go Weight Watchers,’” Dr. Aronne said. “Physicians need better education, need different attitude toward people obesity,” said. “They need recognize disease like diabetes disease treating people for. ” issues facing obese people follow medical system, starting physical exam. Research shown doctors may spend less time obese patients fail refer diagnostic tests. One study asked 122 primary care doctors affiliated one three hospitals within Texas Medical Center Houston attitudes toward obese patients. doctors “reported seeing patients greater waste time heavier were, physicians would like jobs less patients increased size, heavier patients viewed annoying, physicians felt less patience heavier patient was,” researchers wrote. times, doctors may unwittingly influenced unfounded assumptions, attributing symptoms like shortness breath person’s weight without investigating likely causes. happened patient eventually went see Dr. Scott Kahan, obesity specialist Georgetown University. patient, woman, suddenly found almost impossible walk bedroom kitchen. steps left gasping breath.

Scanners handle heavy people manufactured, one national survey found least 90 percent emergency rooms them. Even four five community hospitals deemed bariatric surgery centers excellence lacked scanners could handle heavy people. Yet CT M. R.

But, added, another reason poor outcomes obese cancer patients almost certainly medical care compromised.

Dr. Yates said successfully operated people body mass indexes high 45. behind refusals operate, said, doctors hospitals become fear ratings fall many patients complications. lower score mean reductions reimbursements Medicare. Poor results also lead penalties hospitals and, eventually, doctors. recent survey 700 hip knee surgeons confirmed Dr. Yates’s impressions. percent said used body mass index scores cutoffs requiring weight loss offering surgery. consistency figures picked. “The numbers map,” Dr. Yates said. 42 percent picked body mass index cutoff said done worried performance score hospital. “It’s common pick arbitrary B.

Yet person index of, say, 41 might healthy active, said, terrible pain arthritis. knee replacement could life transforming. “It’s game, everyone trying patient,” Dr. Yates said. “Patients may marginally higher risk may treated class instead individuals. definition discrimination. ” Surgery involves anesthesia, course, giving rise another issue. requirements drug makers figure appropriate doses obese patients. medical experts, like Dr. Hendrikus Lemmens, professor anesthesiology Stanford University, tried provide answers. group looked several drugs: propofol, puts people sleep get general anesthesia succinylcholine, used relax muscles windpipe breathing tube must inserted anesthetic gases.

Подражатели идиотским действиям американских ряженых с бейсбольными битами и бензопилами нашли в Англии благодатную почву. Но ни одного любителя подобной клоунады там не наказали, сочтя их нападения на людей всего лишь невинными шуточками. Однако «тонкий» британский юмор доступен не всем. Вряд ли подобные выходки понравились бы и российским туристам, отправлявшимся этой осенью в туманный Альбион. Посему их всех предупреждали быть осторожными и не бродить по Лондону тёмными вечерами. На европейском континенте эта зараза появилась чуть позже и начала распространяться со скоростью, присущей разве что пресловутому свиному или птичьему гриппу. Но не тут-то было! Законопослушные немцы завалили полицию сообщениями об инцидентах, часть которых, как это бывает повсюду, оказалась ложной. Но лишь часть – в основном, переодетые клоунами шутники пугали прохожих и преследовали их с бейсбольными битами. Были настоящие атаки с ножами и другим оружием. Кое-кто даже пострадал, а некоторые жертвы вполне успешно отбивались, вступая с «клоунами» в драку или опрыскивая их из перцовых баллончиков. Само собой, немецкая полиция не собирается потакать нарушителям спокойствия и призывает всех пострадавших обращаться с жалобами. А что у нас? Миновала ли эта напасть российские города? Ага, как же! И у нас нашлись подобные любители поприкалываться. Один «клоун с вантузом» чего стоит! Только его удалой выход на проезжую часть питерского района Купчино закончился абсолютно бесславно: водитель, коего этот тип в маске собирался напугать, вышел из машины, да так ему наподдал, что тот отлетел на обочину.

(Indeed, 2016 Libertarian Party ticket headed two former Republican governors: Gary Johnson New Mexico Bill Weld Massachusetts.) another analysis, Washington Post concluded five states Trump margin smaller combined Johnson/Stein vote, could flipped entire Stein vote added Clinton’s total. scenario, Post notes, outcome might changed Michigan Wisconsin, still however leaving short Electoral College victory. paper pointed however “this projection rests unrealistic assumption Stein voters would voted Clinton,” conceding impossible “know Johnson Stein backers would voted forced choose Clinton, Trump staying home.” realistically, many would “skipped presidential race voted another candidate .” Besides lack hard statistical data back wasted vote/spoiler effect claims, also rest flawed assumption anyone’s votes – whether Clinton’s, Trump’s, Johnson’s Stein’s – actually belong anyone else. fact, many third-party voters simply fed system itself, hope voting options, might possible someday build viable alternatives two-party system. especially case year, numbers disaffected voters reached historic proportions. time primaries decided last summer, fact, two front-runners unpopular candidates seen generation, seen warning sign Democrats traditionally rely high voter turnout electoral success. According Quinnipiac poll released June, Clinton 57 percent unfavorability rating, Trump received 59 percent unfavorability rating. Moreover, according survey Data Targeting, 55 percent Americans favored independent third-party presidential candidate consider. Among millennials – key demographic Barack Obama’s victories 2008 2012 – 91 percent expressed support additional choices year. Another poll, released September Trump-Clinton debates began, found 76 percent Americans favored Johnson Stein sharing stage two main party candidates debates. This, course, happen, Commission Presidential Debates sticking strict criteria independents third parties need reach 15 percent national polling allowed debates. perhaps one reason Americans remained largely ignorant Stein’s Johnson’s campaigns, Gallup finding 63 percent unfamiliar Johnson heading general election, 68 percent unfamiliar Stein. Voter Boycotts Voter Suppression Regardless impacts third-party alternatives – ended receiving total 4 percent popular vote – deep disaffection among American voters seen earlier polling seemed manifest voting trends Election Day. disaffection seen high number down-ballot voters opted cast ballot president year. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. One telling analysis found 14 states, down-ballot candidates received votes presidential candidates. North Carolina, instance, 30,000 people cast ballots incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory Roy Cooper presidential nominees. Vermont, 314,000 voters cast ballots governor’s race, 313,000 Senate, 291,000 voted president – difference almost 8 percent. Oregon, Democrats Sen. Ron Wyden Gov. Kate Brown easily re-election, races drew 75,000 votes presidential contest. states down-ballot voters essentially boycotted presidential election included Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota, Wisconsin, West Virginia. Besides nonvoters, another factor receiving least much attention third-party “spoilers” would-be voters could cast ballot due systematic disenfranchisement, possible voter suppression all-too-familiar problems polling places. Brennan Center Justice noted Nov. 14, “too many voters contend long lines, malfunctioning voting machines, confusion voting restrictions, voter intimidation, [and] voter registration problems.” nonpartisan law policy institute, documenting flaws U.S. election administration years, notes “2016 first election problems occurred – problem.” Describing numerous instances voting problems across country, group concluded “the ways elections administered, including well resourced, negative impact citizens’ ability cast ballot confidence public system.” Investigative reporter Greg Palast went that, contending “before single vote cast, election fixed GOP Trump operatives.” noted Nov. 11 blog post 2013, Supreme Court overturned key sections Voting Rights Act, Republican operatives created system called Crosscheck purge 1.1 million Americans voter rolls Republican-controlled states. According count, Michigan, Crosscheck purge list eliminated 449,922 voters rolls, Trump claimed victory state 13,107 votes. Arizona, Trump victory margin 85,257 votes, total 270,824 voters eliminated Crosscheck. Trump victory margin North Carolina 177,008, Crosscheck purge list accounted 589,393 voters knocked rolls. Palast notes “the electoral putsch aided nine methods attacking right vote Black, Latino Asian-American voters … including ‘caging,’ ‘purging,’ blocking legitimate registrations, wrongly shunting millions ‘provisional’ ballots never counted.” also points discrepancies exit polling data final results several battleground states, noting exit polling historically “deadly accurate.” Despite this, Palast notes 2016, exit polling mark least four key swing states. According exit polls, Clinton Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania Wisconsin, end day states went Trump. Accounting total 74 Electoral College votes, four states would enough Clinton flipped election. course, assumes Electoral College legitimate first place. fact remains Hillary Clinton received one million votes nationwide Donald Trump, reason assuming White House due arcane controversial system allocating votes Electoral College. led increasing calls abolish Electoral College altogether based idea elections determined principle one person, one vote. Needed Reforms Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson. Needless say, many around world – mention many within United States – elections looking less like free expressions people’s down-and-dirty slug fests either side willing claim victory cost. election observed two international organizations fact, final reports vary considerable degrees, Organization American States Organization Security Cooperation Europe criticized tone election highlighted numerous structural deficiencies way United States chooses leaders. OAS final report identified following issues representing key areas improvement U.S. electoral system: taking measures avoid long lines polling places, broadening cooperation states compare information avoid possible duplications voter registries, expanding practice redistricting nonpartisan commissions, addressing impacts Supreme Court’s decision eliminate parts 1965 Voting Rights Act, establishing better campaign finance rules, jettisoning divisive campaign rhetoric turned many voters process. OAS also noted unusual practice United States simultaneously mandating voter identification providing required identification eligible voters. “Practically countries region provide least one free form national identification citizens, used electoral purposes,” said OAS . “In U.S., 32 states currently laws force require voters show form prescribed identification verify identity casting vote.” However, states make identification readily available citizens, contrary good electoral practice. also weakness OSCE pointed report , noting: “Voter identification rules politically divisive vary across states, 32 states requiring photo identification. high volume litigation regarding voter identification continued Election Day, generating confusion among voters election officials regarding application rules. Efforts ensure integrity vote important, lead disenfranchisement eligible voters.” 57-country organization also noted undue obstacles faced minor parties independents trying compete U.S. elections. “The number signatures required signature submission deadlines vary state state, made cumbersome third party independent candidates register across states presidential elections,” OSCE pointed out. “Both Green Party Libertarian Party challenged ballot access requirements several states, success instances.” organization, monitoring elections United States since 2004, regretted since previous election observation missions, number “priority recommendations remain unaddressed.” pointed “deficiencies legal framework persist, disenfranchisement citizens living various territories, restrictions voting rights convicted criminals infringements secrecy ballot.” Rather focusing blame Trump’s victory Election 2016, Democrats, Republicans, progressives, independent conservatives, third-party supporters, minorities, good-government groups might better served coming together finally taking seriously task electoral reform, beginning addressing key recommendations impartial international observers. Perhaps then, perennial debate endless exchange recriminations might finally come end. Nat Parry co-author Neck Deep: Disastrous Presidency George W. Bush.

Politico reported , Clinton’s experiment “had business center: Aid would replaced investment, growth would turn benefit United States.” “Clinton announced Haiti would laboratory United States could road-test new approaches development, taking advantage ‘the power proximity.’” One first acts new “business-centered” Haiti policy involved suppressing Haiti’s minimum wage. 2009 Haitian law raised minimum wage 61 cents hour, 24 cents hour previously. Haitian garment manufacturers, including contractors Hanes Levi Strauss, furious, insisting willing agree seven-cent increase. manufacturers approached U.S. State Department, brought intense pressure bear Haitian President René Préval, working “aggressively block” 37-cent increase. U.S. Deputy Mission Chief said minimum-wage increase “did take economic reality account” simply “appealed unemployed underpaid masses.” Ryan Chittum Columbia Journalism Review explained , proposed wage increase would trivial additional expense American garment manufacturers: “As last year Hanes 3,200 Haitians making t-shirts it. Paying two bucks day would cost $1.6 million year. Hanesbrands Incorporated made $211 million $4.3 billion sales last year, presumably would pass least higher labor costs consumers. better yet, Hanesbrands CEO Richard Noll could forego rich compensation package. could pay raises 3,200 t-shirt makers one-sixth $10 million salary bonus raked last year.” “U.S. Deputy Mission Chief said minimum-wage increase ‘did take economic reality account” simply ‘appealed unemployed underpaid masses.’” truth “economic reality” Haitian undergarment sector hardly likely become wildly less competitive result increase. effort suppress minimum wage solely Clinton project. also “concerted effort part Haitian elites, factory owners, free trade proponents, U.S. politicians, economists, American companies.” keeping State Department’s priorities Clinton, prioritized creating favorable business climate. familiar Clinton move “from aid trade.” Bill Clinton’s program Haitian development, designed Oxford University economist Paul Collier, “ garment exports center.” Collier wrote “propitious” factors like “poverty [a] relatively unregulated labor market, Haiti labor costs fully competitive China.” Clintons’ role Haiti would soon expand even further. 2010, country struck worst earthquake history. disaster killed 160,000 people displaced 1.5 million more. (The consequences earthquake exacerbated ruined state Haitian food economy, plus concentration unemployed Haitian farmers Port-au-Prince.) Bill Clinton soon put charge U.S.-led recovery effort. appointed head Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), would oversee wide range rebuilding projects. President Obama’s request, Clinton George W. Bush created “Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund,” began aggressively fundraising around world support Haiti earthquake’s aftermath. (With Hillary Clinton Secretary State overseeing efforts USAID, Clintons’ importance recovery could overstated; Bill’s appointment meant “at every stage Haiti’s reconstruction—fundraising, oversight allocation—a Clinton involved.” Despite appearances, Clinton-Bush fund focused providing traditional relief. wrote , “[w]hile organizations Haiti using resources deliver immediate humanitarian aid, using resources focus long-term development.” fund would advertise “100% donations go directly relief efforts,” Clinton Bush adopted expansive definition “relief” efforts, treating luring foreign investment jobs crucial part earthquake recovery. website, spoke proudly New York Daily News characterized program “supporting longterm programs develop Haiti’s business class.” “At every stage Haiti’s reconstruction—fundraising, oversight allocation—a Clinton involved.” strategy odd one. Port-au-Prince reduced ruin, Haitians crowded filthy tent cities, many dying cholera outbreak (which caused negligence United Nations). Whatever value building new garment factories may longterm economic plan, Haitians faced somewhat pressing concerns like basic provision shelter medicine, well clearing thousands tons rubble filled streets. Clinton-led recovery disaster. year earthquake, stinging report Oxfam singled Clinton’s IHRC creating “quagmire indecision delay” made little progress toward successful earthquake recovery. Oxfam found that: “…less half reconstruction aid promised international donors disbursed. money put toward temporary housing, almost none funds used rubble removal.” Instead, Clinton Foundation, IHRC, State Department created Wall Street Journal writer called “a mishmash low quality, poorly thought-out development experiments half-finished projects.” Haitian IHRC members lamented commission produced “a disparate bunch approved projects. . . [that] address whole either emergency situation recovery, let alone development, Haiti.” 2013 investigation Government Accountability Office found money recovery dispersed, projects worked plagued delays cost overruns. Many Clinton projects extravagant public relations affairs quickly fizzled. example, Washington Post reported : “…[a] 2011 housing expo cost $2 million, including $500,000 Clinton Foundation, supposed model thousands new units instead resulted little dozen abandoned model homes occupied squatters.” “ stinging report Oxfam singled Clinton’s IHRC creating ‘quagmire indecision delay.’” Clinton ventures seen “disconnected realities people poorest country Western Hemisphere.” Politico reported many Clinton projects “have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners island’s ruling elite, needed little help begin with.” example, “the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund invested $2 million Royal Oasis Hotel, sleek suite hardwood floors costs $200 night shops sell $150 designer purses $120 men’s dress shirts.” Predictably, Royal Oasis didn’t especially roaring trade; Washington Post reported “[o]ne recent afternoon, hotel appeared largely empty, tourism hardly booming five years quake, locals fear may failing.” country 30-cent minimum wage, investing recovery dollars luxury hotel offensive, economically daft. Sometimes recovery projects accused pointless, downright harmful. instance, Bill Clinton proudly announced Clinton Foundation would funding “construction emergency storm shelters Léogâne.” investigation shelters Foundation actually built found “shoddy dangerous” full toxic mold. Nation discovered , among things, temperature shelters reached 100 degrees, causing children experience headaches eye irritations (which may compounded mold), trailers showed high levels carcinogenic formaldehyde, linked asthma lung diseases. Clinton Foundation subcontracted building shelters Clayton Homes, firm already sued United States Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) “having provided formaldehyde-laced trailers Hurricane Katrina victims.” (Clayton Homes owned Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett longstanding major donor Clinton Foundation.) Nation ’s investigation reported children whose classes held Clinton Foundation trailers. semester cut short, students sent home, temperature classrooms grown unbearable. misery students Clinton trailers described: “Judith Seide, student Lubert’s sixth-grade class [explained that] classmates regularly suffer painful headaches new Clinton Foundation classroom. Every day, said, ‘head hurts feel spinning stop moving, otherwise I’d fall.’ vision goes dark, case classmate Judel, sometimes can’t open eyes because, said Seide, ‘he’s allergic heat.’ teacher regularly relocates class outside shade trailer swelter inside insufferable. Sitting sixth-grade classroom, student Mondialie Cineas, dreams becoming nurse, said three times week teacher gives classmates painkillers make school day. ‘At noon, class gets hot, kids get headaches,’ 12-year-old said, wiping beads sweat brow. worried ‘the kids feel sick, can’t work, can’t advance succeed.’” “Three times week teacher gives classmates painkillers make school day.” notorious post-earthquake development project, however, Caracol industrial park . park pitched major job creator, part goal helping Haiti “build back better” before. State Department touted prospect 100,000 new jobs Haitians, Hillary Clinton promising 65,000 jobs within five years. industrial park followed Clintons’ preexisting development model Haiti: public/private partnerships heavy emphasis garment industry. Even though still hundreds thousands evacuees living tents, project based “the expansive view that, desperately poor country traditional foreign aid chronically failed, fostering economic development important replacing fell down.” Much planning focused trying lure South Korean clothing manufacturer set shop there, plying U.S. taxpayer funding. Caracol project “the centerpiece” U.S.’s recovery effort. gala celebrating opening featured Clintons Sean Penn, treated emblem new, “better” Haiti, would demonstrate country’s commitment “open business.” order build park, hundreds poor farmers evicted land, millions dollars could spent transforming it. project terrible disappointment. four years, operating 10% capacity , jobs failed materialize : Far 100,000 jobs—or even 60,000 promised within five years park’s opening— “Caracol currently employs 5,479 people full time. comes roughly $55,000 investment per job created far; or, put another way, 30 times per job average [Caracol] worker makes per year. park, built site former U.S. Marine-run slave labor camp 1915-1934 U.S. occupation, best-paved roads manicured sidewalks country, land remains vacant.” seized farmland went unused, then, even remaining farmers, “ surges wastewater caused floods spoiled crops.” Huge queues unemployed Haitians stood daily front factory, awaiting jobs exist. Washington Post described scene: “Each morning, crowds line outside park’s big front gate, guarded four men crisp khaki uniforms carrying shotguns. wait sliver shade next cinder-block wall, many holding résumés envelopes. said coming every day months, waiting jobs pay $5 day. envelope, Jean Mito Palvetus, 27, pulled diploma attesting completed 200 hours training U.S. Agency International Development industrial sewing machine. ‘I three kids wife, can’t support them,’ said, sweating hot morning sun. ‘I diploma, still can’t get job here. still nothing.’” “ interests market, interest foreigners prioritized majority people impoverished Haiti.” , Caracol project perfectly symbolized Clinton approach: big promises, emphasis sweatshops, incompetent management, little concern actual impact Haitians. “Caracol prime example bad help,” one Haiti scholar put . “The interests market, interest foreigners prioritized majority people impoverished Haiti.” But, failure may been, Caracol factory among successful projects, insofar actually came existence. large amount money raised Bill Clinton earthquake, pledged U.S. Hillary Clinton, simply disappeared without trace, whereabouts unknown. Politico explained : “Even Bill’s U.N. Office Special Envoy couldn’t track [it] went—and truth still today one really knows much money spent ‘rebuilding’ Haiti. Many initial pledges never materialized. whopping $465 million relief money went Pentagon, spent deployment U.S. troops—20,000 high water mark, many never set foot Haitian soil. money included fuel ships planes, helicopter repairs inscrutables $18,000 contract jungle gym… Huge contracts doled usual array major contractors, including $16.7 million logistics contract whose partners included Agility Public Warehousing KSC, Kuwaiti firm supposed blacklisted business Washington 2009 indictment alleging conspiracy defraud U.S. government Iraq War.” recovery Clintons became notorious mismanagement. Clinton staffers “ idea Haiti like sensitivity Haitians.” reportedly rude condescending toward Haitians, even refusing admit Haitian government ministers meetings recovery plans. Clintons called high-profile consulting firms like McKinsey draw plans, little interest listening Haitians themselves. former Haitian prime minister spoke “weak” American staff “more interested supporting Clinton helping Haiti.” “A large amount money raised Bill Clinton earthquake, pledged U.S. Hillary Clinton, simply disappeared without trace, whereabouts unknown.” One shocked failure recovery effort Chelsea Clinton, wrote detailed email parents said Haitians trying help themselves, every part international aid effort, governmental nongovernmental, falling short. “The incompetence mind numbing,” wrote . Chelsea produced detailed memorandum recommending drastic steps needed taken order get recovery track. memo kept within Clinton family, released later Freedom Information Act disclosure Hillary’s State Department correspondence. come time, Haiti journalist Jonathan Katz writes , “would obliterated public narrative helpful outsiders saving grateful earthquake survivors mother’s State Department working hard promote.” Clintons’ Haiti recovery ended whimper. Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund distributed last funds 2012 disbanded, without attempt fundraising. IHRC “ quietly closed doors” October 2011, even though little progress made. Boston Review ’s Jake Johnston explained , though hundreds thousands remained displaced, IHRC wiped hands housing situation: “[L]ittle remained grand plans build thousands new homes. Instead, left homeless would given small, one-time rental subsidy $500. subsidies, funded number different aid agencies, meant give private companies incentive invest building houses. efforts rebuild whole neighborhoods faltered, rental subsidies turned Haitians consumers, housing problem handed private sector.” Clintons simply stopped speaking Haiti. first two years, “nowhere seen” there, despite Hillary’s promised commitment Haiti would long outlast tenure Secretary State. Haiti given little attention Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, even though Haiti project ostensibly one great pride Clintons. “One shocked failure recovery effort Chelsea Clinton.” widespread consensus among observers Haiti recovery, TIME called U.S.’s “compassionate invasion,” catastrophically mismanaged disappointment. Jonathan Katz writes “it’s hard find anyone days looks back U.S.-led response January 12, 2010, Haiti earthquake success.” plenty money channeled country, largely went “little small pilot projects—a new set basketball hoops model elementary school here, functioning factory there.” end result little changed Haiti. “Haitians find social economic situation worse earthquake,” reports Belgian photojournalist spent 10 years Haiti: “Everyone says they’re living worse conditions before… look history humanitarian relief, there’s never situation small country target massive influx money assistance short span time… paper, much money territory size Haiti, witnessed miracles; results.” “If anything, appear worse off,” says Foreign Policy Haiti’s farmers. “I really cannot understand could raise much money, put former U.S. president charge, get outcome,” said one Haitian official. Indeed, money donated invested extraordinary. nobody seems know gone. Haitians direct much blame toward Clintons. former Haitian government official worked recovery said , “[t]here lot resentment Clinton here. People seen results. . .. say Clinton used Haiti.” Haitians “ increasingly complain Clinton-backed projects often helped country’s elite international business investors helped poor ‘Haitians.” “suspicion motives make profit Haiti help it.” “striking populist pose, practice attracted power Haiti.” perhaps forgiving Clintons’ conduct Haitian recovery. all, instead true harm, Clintons simply failed much good. perhaps it’s better luxury hotel one, better jobs none all. Thanks Bill Clinton, there’s gleaming new industrial park, albeit one operating fraction capacity. Yet it’s mistake measure Clinton would happened United States done nothing Haiti. question would happened capable, nonfamous administrator, rather globetrotting narcissist, placed charge. Tens millions dollars donated toward Haiti recovery people across world; incredible outpouring generosity. squandering money half-baked development schemes (mainly led cronies ), ignoring Haitians’ demands, mean Clinton may caused considerable harm failure. Plenty people died tent cities would died world’s donations used effectively. “Defending Clintons’ Haiti record impossible endeavor.” Democrats bristled recent attempts Donald Trump criticize Hillary Clinton record Haiti. Jonathan Katz, whose in-depth reporting Haiti stingingly critical Clintons, changed tune , insisting bear responsibility failed recovery effort. Trump accused Clintons squandering millions building “a sweatshop” Haiti form Caracol park, media fact-checkers quickly insisted spewing Pinocchios. Washington Post said Clinton Foundation donors may financially benefited factory-building project, benefited “writ large” rather “directly.” Post cited words factory’s spokesman evidence factory sweatshop, pointed Caracol workers earned least “minimum wage” (failing mention minimum wage Haiti remains well dollar). PolitiFact also rated sweatshop claim “mostly false,” even though Katz notes “long hours, tough conditions, low pay” factory PolitiFact acknowledges “ongoing theft legally-earned wages.” Defending Clintons’ Haiti record impossible endeavor, one Democrats probably bother attempting. Center Economic Policy Research, studied recovery, noted , comes Clinton-led recovery mission, “it’s hard say it’s anything failure.” Haitians delusional resentment Clintons; good reason feel used publicity, discarded Clintons became inconvenient. None means one vote Donald Trump president. tears Haiti highly opportunistic crocodile, interest country’s wellbeing began precise moment could used bludgeon beat political opponent. previously noted publication , one need convinced Hillary Clinton honorable person order convinced preferable candidate. important, however, maintain illusions, stifle massage truth service short-term electoral concerns. remains simultaneously true Clinton presidency present least-worst option Clintons Haiti callous, selfish, indefensible.",1, Fake

CORINNA da Granted, Met season unusually narrow: 71 percent performances operas Puccini, Verdi, Donizetti Rossini. Heavier doses Gounod, Massenet, Wagner Strauss make appear somewhat better balanced, enough. unusual repertory tough sell, offerings essential sustainable future. Met start edging often Eastern Europe: Janacek appear every year, Mussorgsky, Prokofiev Shostakovich deserve occasional outings. there’s matter time. cavernous theater hindrance, admittedly, Gluck Handel ought mainstays, rarities. occasional forays John Adams, alongside Muhly Adès commissions, aren’t nearly enough contemporary work. DAVID ALLEN years ago, president opera club Columbia Law School asked would join members one regular lunchtime meetings. showed up, amazement, 150 students attendance enormous stack pizzas. Met actively assist encourage clubs opera lovers shared interests. Met could arrange discounted tickets designated performances even host receptions clubs special guests, like singers young artists program might perform couple arias. ANTHONY TOMMASINI One seemingly simple way draw bigger crowds: perform it’s convenient audiences. major opera houses, ballet companies Broadway shows find Sunday performances among popular, Met retains longstanding schedule dates back days strict blue laws. Many operagoers find weeknight performances difficult, especially operas last three hours longer. 8 p. m. start late older patrons suburbanites face long commutes final curtain. earlier starts tough many people typically work much later 5 p. m. — especially want able eat dinner. Sunday matinees would simpler people groups could appeal operagoers afield. Peter Gelb, Met’s general manager, suggested adding Sunday performances, need win agreement Met’s unions, whose workers often punishing schedules agreed concessions last contracts. going dark weekday would cut Met’s rehearsal schedules. MICHAEL COOPER Every orchestra, seems, artist residence: fact, New York Philharmonic’s season Eric Owens. Met? Planning tough, course, enough lead time, couldn’t singer participate three (or four, five) productions season, well concerts, recitals, lectures? audiences know (and love) performer, eager they’ll buy tickets see her.

CORINNA da One “festival” already offered Met, although it’s summer HD screenings Lincoln Center Plaza. And, admittedly, festivals used tools progress reaction: New York Philharmonic biennial, also Dvorak Rachmaninoff celebrations. Even so, festival main season — done properly — would let Met draw attention new productions trotting old ones, help build excitement unusual repertoire give opportunity collaboration other, institutions. Imagine series looking Orpheus myth time, Monteverdi Birtwistle. treatments Shakespeare, balancing Verdi Barber, Reimann Adès. Think could done forgotten Romantics, like Korngold Schreker.

Consider marketing occasional matinee opera families, too, rules affordable snacks intermission. you’re it, take hint New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, players hang front stage intermission take questions audience members. Send choristers costume lobbies pose selfies. CORINNA da New Yorkers like dress up: Get game. Met mark dates Fashion Week throw open doors gala performances enforce strict dress code. Invite runway star dress entire cast one production, apologies regular costume designer, auction clothes. Don’t let Met Costume Institute steal paparazzi attention. CORINNA da audiences linger performances at, say, Park Avenue Armory, rush Met? It’s there’s comfortable, exciting space opera house sit down, chat, unexpected . idea?

Although quite economists disagree merits prescriptions, said cutting taxes, restricting immigration renegotiating trade deals ultimately raise incomes struggling families.

Democrats favored refundable tax credits deductions say helpful families, might make enough pay income taxes. Also, credits directly reduce someone’s tax bill, deductions reduce taxable income necessarily final bill.

973,"Политика Дмитрий Анатольевич Медведев знаком российскому обществу не как целомудренный политик, а как человек, ставящий превыше всего здоровье и хорошее настроение. Но на днях людям открылась другая грань главы правительства – в его душе, оказывается, затаился ярый патриот-кофеман, жаждущий всеми силами вырваться наружу. Никто бы не обратил внимания, что Дмитрий Анатольевич 16 ноября зарядился дозой здоровья и отправился на подписание соглашений по результатам заседания Евразийского межправительственного совета, Глава правительства предложил переименовать кофе «американо» в «русиано». А началось все с белорусов. Российский премьер не смог удержаться и не похвалить белорусских коллег за конструктивное поведение во время заседания. Белорусский премьер Андрей Кобяков в ответ на похвалу ответил, что его адекватное поведение вызвано чашечкой кофе (вполне возможно, что если бы Кобяков выпил пару чашек кофе, то с легкостью нашел бы лекарство от рака, поборол на планете голод и наладил бы связи с внеземными цивилизациями). Медведев заметил, что слово «американо» звучит неполиткорректно, и предложил изменить название напитка, отвечающего за конструктивное поведение. Уже через секунду тишину нарушило славное, мелодичное, а главное – крайне патриотичное слово «русиано». Ну, звучит же! И никого не волнует, что словом «американо» изначально был назван способ приготовления кофе. Да и придумали его вовсе не американцы, а итальянцы для окупировавших их страну военных из США. Только представьте, теперь, желая заказать в кафе бодрящий напиток, вам не придется вспоминать это ужасное слово, пропитанное духом капитализма, буржуазии и хорошей жизни. Ведь есть новая исконно русская замена, которая олицетворяет всю могучесть и силу русской речи. Русиано – вместо тысячи слов… Русиано затмило собой все достижения совета и стало главным событием дня. Пользователи сети начали гадать, сколько же спирта будет входить в новый напиток и будет ли в нем сам кофе. Между тем, всплыли новые подробности – предложение о переименовании «американо» внес Медведев, а вот «отцом» русиано является армянский премьер. Но запущенный механизм было уже не остановить. Одно екатеринбургское кафе мгновенно отреагировало на идею переименования кофе. В баре с обнадеживающим названием «Огонек» не только появилось русиано, но и исчезли все англоязычные позиции в меню. Виски Jack Daniels переименовали в «Жора Денисов», а стейк New York — в «Воронеж». Забавно, что из всех российских городов организаторы решили, что именно Воронеж имеет больше всего сходств с Нью-Йорком. Гордый Manhattan превратился в «Марьину рощу», а Bronx отныне величают «Бирюлево». Странно только, что чувство патриотизма у отечественных политиков однобокое. Они прославляют импортозамещение и не любят американские названия, но это не мешает им носить айфоны и приобретать недвижимость в Америке.",1, Fake

Она оказалась бухгалтером в фирме Ирины Луценко. Затем все у того же сельского бухгалтера обнаружилась еще одна недвижимость — квартира в Ялте общей площадью в 145 метров, которую все местные так и называют ""квартирой Луценко"".Ее не так давно выставили на продажу за 1 миллион долларов, отметил Лещенко. ""Однако, кроме дома в Киеве, у бухгалтера Луценко из села оказалась еще одна недвижимость — в Крыму. Это квартира вЯлте площадью 145 метров, которая недавно была выставлена на продажу за 1 млн долларов"", — отметил Лещенко. ""Другими словами, Луценко, всю жизнь работавший на госслужбе, оформил на подставных лиц огромных размеров дорогостоящую недвижимость, не имея подтвержденных для этого легальных доходов"", — заявил Лещенко. По словам депутата, Луценко продал недвижимость в Киеве депутату от Блока Порошенко Глебу Загорию после развязавшегося скандала. Напомним, как сообщала Правда. Ру, генпрокурором Украины Юрий Луценко стал в мае 2016 года, сменив на этом посту ставшего неугодным экс-генпрокурора Виктора Шокина, на отставке которого настаивали американские кураторы украинской власти. Представил к назначению Луценко лично Петр Порошенко . При этом президенту Украины даже пришлось внести некоторые законодательные изменения: Порошенко подписал закон о Генпрокуратуре, согласно которому ведомство может возглавить человек без юридического образования. В том, что эти изменения писались исключительно под кандидатуру нового генпрокурора, сомневаться не приходится. Несмотря на то, что Луценко не имеет профильного образования, он целых два раза успел возглавить МВД Украины. Есть в его биографии и другие ""полезные"" для занимаемой должности факты. К примеру, в 2010 году Луценко был арестован, а через два года — и осужден на 4 года по делу о растрате государственных средств в особо крупных размерах. В 2013 году Виктор Янукович своим президентским указом помиловал ряд осужденных, среди которых оказался и Луценко. Спустя еще год в судебном порядке с будущего генпрокурора были сняты все обвинения, а сам он признан ""политически пострадавшим"" от репрессий прежнего руководства страны.

1156,"Общество » Практика » Как отдохнуть Как изменить жизнь к лучшему с помощью фэншуй? Как организовать домашнее пространство так, чтобы вещи работали на ваше благо? Почему специалисты по фэншуй против стеклянных столов и с осторожностью относятся к зеркалам? В какую сторону света все же лучше спать головой? Секреты фэншуй для Pravda.Ru раскрыла мастер фэншуй Татьяна Мизгирева. 0 комментариев 1 поделились — Фэншуй — это наука? — Да, фэншуй - это наука. Но это не наука с точки зрения какой-то западной доказательной базы, это наука с точки зрения восточного взгляда. Разные школы фэншуй, традиции, передачи развивались тысячелетиями - и развивались за счет наблюдений. У каждой из них создалась огромная накопительная статистическая база. То есть, когда что-то одно повторяется десять раз, вы думаете, что в этом есть какая-то закономерность. Но если сто, тысячу раз этот эффект повторился, то это уже можно назвать научной статистикой, но в восточном ключе. — Давайте рассмотрим домашнее пространство. Начнем с прихожей. Какие ошибки чаще всего делают люди в оформлении своей прихожей? Каких вещей там не должно быть в принципе, а какие вещи или цвета, наоборот, благоприятно влияют на жизнь хозяев этой квартиры? — Самая частая и распространенная ошибка — это расположение зеркала напротив входной двери, в особенности если прихожая небольшая. Если прихожая огромная и где-то вдали находится зеркало, то это не так страшно. Но если у нас от входной двери до ближайшей стены напротив полтора-два метра и сразу же висит зеркало, то это будет серьезно обесточивать квартиру. Потому что зеркало на сто процентов отталкивает все входящие воздушные потоки, а с ними и жизненно важную энергию Ци, которая приходит вместе с потоками воздуха. Таким образом, квартира обесточивается, и это проявляется в жизни людей, возникают проблемы, такие как трудности в получении работы, новых проектов, невозможность реализовать себя, трудности в общении. Как будто бы пространство стоит спиной к нам, и вся жизнь отвернулась, и все приходит с колоссальным трудом. Стоит только убрать это зеркало и перевесить его таким образом, чтобы оно перенаправляло вглубь квартиры все эти воздушные потоки, и можно почувствовать сразу же, в течение нескольких дней, что жизнь кардинальным образом поменяется. Как будто все снова повернулось к вам лицом и начинает помогать. Это очень важно. Еще одна ошибка, которую очень часто можно встретить в прихожих, - это недостаточно яркий свет. Все-таки прихожая — это так называемая ""янская зона"". Там должна быть сильная активность, и там должен быть яркий свет. Нужно не поскупиться на хорошую лампочку, которая будет все хорошо освещать. Известно, что яркий свет привлекает яркие, сильные энергии. Также в прихожей надо добавить простора. То есть чем менее заставлена входная зона, тем легче воздушным потокам войти в квартиру и наполнить ее. Кроме того, хорошо здесь использовать какие-то позитивные красивые символы — то, с чем мы бы хотели отождествляться. Потому что когда мы входим в квартиру, мы видим первый символ, с которым мы отождествляемся. И если мы входим и перед нами, например, находится картина ""Иван Грозный убивает своего сына"", то это посылает определенные импульсы, это то, чего следовало бы избегать. — Теперь предлагаю поговорить о гостиной. Это место, где отдыхает вся семья, собирается вечерами, общается, смотрит телевизор. Какие предметы будут благоприятно влиять на людей в гостиной? — Я бы сказала, что здесь нет какой-то одной общей рекомендации. Это зависит и от того, в какую сторону света смотрит гостиная, и какие люди там живут. Это очень индивидуально. Главное, чтобы это было комфортно для людей. Другие рекомендации, которые я могла бы дать, - это то, что здесь надо избегать обилия острых углов, которые были бы направлены на диванную группу, или нависающих полок. Мне встречались такие квартиры, где стоит диван и над ним висят тяжелые полки. Конечно, в таком месте особо сильно не расслабишься и не восстановишься, потому что то, что нависает, будет давить и бессознательно вызывать чувство угнетения. Еще часто в гостиной располагают перед диваном или креслами журнальный столик, на который можно поставить какие-то угощения или еще что-то. И стало очень модным использовать стеклянные столы. Это тоже не очень хорошо, потому что мы знаем, что стеклянная поверхность может разбиться. Поэтому всякий раз, когда мы ставим что-либо на этот стеклянный стол и слышим стеклянный звук, то у нас возникает легкий спазм в теле. И, таким образом, мы не расслабляемся, а продолжаем оставаться в напряжении. А ведь гостиная — это то место, где бы мы хотели отдохнуть. Поэтому я советую либо не использовать такие столы, либо если такой стол уже есть, то можно просто покрыть его непрозрачной скатертью или чем-то еще. — Довольно часто в магазинах можно встретить небольшие деревца, на которых висят монетки, и считается, что это принесет финансовое благополучие в дом. Некоторые люди считают необходимым в своей гостиной разместить такое дерево. Как оно в действительности будет влиять на жизнь владельцев квартиры? — Само по себе дерево — это сувенир с монетами. Использование этих сувениров дома и в офисах — это китайское наследие. И, на самом деле, его предназначение в том, чтобы напоминать своему хозяину о его цели, чтобы он активно действовал в направлении достижения своих финансовых задач. Мы можем расположить такое деревце с монетами рядом с пышным растением. И хорошо будет, если мы поставим рядом, например, декоративный фонтанчик или водопадик, потому что именно эти предметы будут активно создавать энергию. Растения за счет своего роста продуцируют янскую энергию, а фонтанчик создает ее за счет циркуляции воды, что также создает избыток кислорода в этом месте. И если мы поставим это дерево с монетами, то мы, таким образом, поставим в нашей квартире маркер, что для меня благосостояние — это важно и я хочу, чтобы энергия направилась в этом русле. И тогда, всякий раз видя эту композицию, у нас будет запускаться процесс мышления: ""А что же нужно сделать для того, чтобы это благосостояние пришло в мою жизнь?"" И оно будет напоминать нам и толкать нас в этом направлении, чтобы мы были более активными в достижении того, что нам нужно в жизни. — То есть цветы в доме — это хорошо не только с точки зрения насыщения кислородом, но и с точки зрения фэншуй? — Да, конечно. Тем более, есть даже специальные сектора в комнатах, которые полезны для того, чтобы там были растения, чтобы более активная энергия усиливалась. А такие растения, у которых есть цветущие бутоны, или срезанные цветы в определенных местах усиливают романтическую удачу. И это ценно для тех, кто хочет обрести счастливое партнерство. — Наверное, все мы хотим, чтобы дома был порядок, но за неимением большого количества свободного времени довольно часто порядок превращается в беспорядок. В результате мы имеем завалы вещей и на стульях, и на открытых полках. Как это влияет на жизнь человека? Это просто некрасиво визуально или это еще способно вызывать какие-то негативные события? — В каком-то смысле да. Наше внешнее пространство отражает, во-первых, наше внутреннее состояние, и мы это также потом проецируем в мир. То есть если бардак чрезмерный, то он создает и некое хаотичное мышление, и проецируется на наши события в жизни. Живем мы так же хаотично, без какого-то планирования, бесконтрольно. И тут уже все зависит от талантов человека, от того, как он может управляться с этим хаосом в своей жизни. Еще важно, чтобы предметы, которыми мы пользуемся, были более-менее в движении. То есть какие-то хаотичные завалы, конечно, не хороши, но если еще человек этим не пользуется, и оно просто лежит как груда, то это как тромб. А это значит, что где-то внутри в жизни есть какой-то тромб, потому что внешнее и внутреннее неразделимо, все связано. Поэтому важно, чтобы мы пользовались тем, что у нас есть. Если мы не пользуемся, то, возможно, это просто не нужно, это нужно куда-то переместить, продать, выбросить. — Давайте перейдем к спальне. Это место, где мы отдыхаем, где мы проводим много часов подряд, когда спим. Очень много споров идет о том, в какую сторону лучше спать головой. Есть какие-то рекомендации? — Да, конечно, они существуют, но, к сожалению, я не могу дать одного общего совета. Я часто слышу, что головой нужно спать только на север или только на восток. Это абсолютная неправда. Люди индивидуальны, и каждому человеку соответствует несколько благоприятных направлений и несколько неблагоприятных. Это можно прочувствовать интуитивно. Какая здесь возникает чаще всего проблема? Человек ставит кровать каким-то классическим, традиционным способом, но чувствует себя некомфортно, неуютно, не высыпается, ворочается или ему снятся плохие сны. Это признак того, что данное место, или направление, или и место, и направление не подходят этому человеку. Тогда нужно попытаться найти какое-то нешаблонное решение. Может быть, переставить кровать в другое место, или даже иногда эту кровать стоит поставить под углом, защитив тыльную часть кровати, чтобы она не смотрела в пустой угол. То есть нужно проявить креативность, послушать свою интуицию, чтобы найти это хорошее место. И тело обязательно сообщит об этом, вы легко почувствуете, что так спать гораздо лучше, комфортнее, вы лучше засыпаете, легче просыпаетесь, нужно будет меньше времени, чтобы выспаться и т.д. Не рекомендуют располагать в спальне зеркала. Если есть все-таки острая необходимость, то желательно повесить зеркала таким образом, чтобы человек, лежа на кровати, не видел своего отражения. На самом деле, это может немного пугать во сне, когда ты просыпаешься, встаешь и видишь свое отражение. И вообще, какие-то блики, силуэты, тени, лучи на зеркалах могут просто тревожить. Потом, зеркала создают объем, дополнительное измерение, и тоже во время сна это может беспокоить. — Коснемся наиболее важных сфер нашей жизни — это здоровье, карьера, финансовое благополучие и личные взаимоотношения. Дайте, пожалуйста, короткие рекомендации, что сделать, чтобы во всех сферах жизнь стала немножечко лучше. — Что касается здоровья, должно быть больше энергии в квартире или в доме. Для этого квартира должна хорошо проветриваться, не быть захламленной. Если говорить о романтической удаче, о партнерстве, то важно следить за тем, что если у нас есть сложности в этом, чтобы в квартире не было каких-то одиноких символов: изображений одинокой тоскующей дамы или, опять же, картины ""Иван Грозный убивает своего сына"". Таких изображений не должно быть. Напротив, нужно привнести в интерьер как можно больше партнерских символов, которые символизируют счастливые взаимоотношения: две свечи, две птицы, две кошечки. А что касается бизнеса, успеха, процветания, то полезно правильным образом расположить рабочий стол, за которым вы работаете. Расположение стола должно быть таким: за спиной должна быть стена, с левой стороны - какая-то защита, а перед нами - открытое пространство. Тогда у нас достаточно много фантазии, есть тыл за спиной, и мы гораздо лучше функционируем. Беседовала Марина Архипова К публикации подготовила Мария Сныткова Читайте также:",1, Real

1191,"В августе 2016 г. в г. Чанчунь (КНР) состоялся 21-й Саммит по международному обмену и сотрудничеству региональных администраций стран Северо-Восточной Азии. В нем приняли участие делегации из России, Китая, Республики Корея, Монголии и Японии. Высокопоставленные представители указанных государств обсудили важные вопросы сотрудничества в области торговли, транспорта, экологии и др. Помимо прочих важных вопросов межгосударственного сотрудничества, немалое внимание было уделено развитию регионального туризма, в котором Приморью предстоит сыграть значительную роль. В частности, говорили о возможностях развития морского туризма и создании постоянного туристического маршрута, который соединит Приморье, Республику Корея, Китай и Японию. Планы, озвученные на Саммите, не были забыты: стороны немедленно приступили к работе. Уже в октябре 2016 г. Приморье встречало гостей из Южной Кореи, которые прибыли обсудить подробности проекта. Возглавлял делегацию Пак Тэ Ук, глава Морского туристического центра провинции Кангвон. Во время встречи с администрацией Приморского края он заявил, что Владивосток должен стать узловой точкой круизной и паромной линий Азиатско-Тихоокеанского региона. Столица Приморского края уже успела принять один круизный лайнер из Южной Кореи – в мае 2016 г. его посетила «Коста Виктория». Владивосток произвел на корейских туристов неизгладимое впечатление. Стало очевидно, что развитие туризма в этом направлении способно принести огромные доходы как российской, так и корейской стороне. По словам Пак Тэ Ука, в 2017 г. «Коста Виктория» посетит столицу Приморья шесть раз. Кроме того, туда станут совершать рейсы и другие корабли. Таким образом, корейские туристы начнут прибывать в город каждый месяц, а постоянная работа маршрута начнется уже в феврале 2017 г. Маршрут включает порт Тяньцзинь в Китае, Пусан и Сокчо в Южной Корее, Сакайминато и Хаката в Японии и Владивосток в России. Когда он заработает, общее число круизных судов, посещающих Приморье за год, возрастет втрое. Как заметил господин Пак, особое значение новым круизным маршрутам в регионе придают грядущие Олимпийские игры. Ближайшие три Олимпиады должны пройти именно в странах Северо-Восточной Азии – Южной Корее, Японии и Китае. Ввиду этого развитие судоходства и авиаперевозок в регионе становится жизненно важным и чрезвычайно прибыльным. В целом, следует отметить, что постепенно Владивосток становится все более значимым культурным и торговым центром в СВА, способствуя при этом развитию всего Приморья. Одновременно он набирает все большую популярность у иностранных туристов. Важным фактором, способствующим этому, стало принятие закона, позволяющего с начала 2016 г. иностранцам въезд и нахождение во Владивостоке в течение 8 дней без визы. По прогнозам Департамента международного сотрудничества Приморского края, за еще не окончившийся 2016 год во Владивостоке побывает более 500 тыс. иностранных туристов. Помимо «Коста Виктория», в текущем году столица Приморья приняла еще пять круизных лайнеров. Так, в марте 2016 г. во Владивосток прибыл немецкий лайнер « Artania », а в мае – японский « Nippon Maru ». В июле столицу Приморья впервые посетил знаменитый круизный лайнер «Sun Princess», совершавший рейс из Сиднея в Токио через Малайзию, Гонконг, Шанхай и Сеул. Этот огромный корабль, имеющий длину 261 метров и водоизмещение 77 441 тонн, вмещает экипаж из 1000 человек и 2200 пассажиров. После спуска на воду в 1995 г. «Sun Princess» считался одним из крупнейших круизных лайнеров в мире. Несмотря на то, что с тех пор появились и гораздо более крупные лайнеры, он по-прежнему остается всемирно известным, как одно из самых популярных и комфортабельных туристических судов. Принадлежит «Sun Princess» одной из самых больших в мире круизных компаний, мультинациональной «Carnival Corporation». Прибытие судна такого уровня – очередное свидетельство того, что Владивосток становится одним из ключевых портов АТР. Более того, за последние несколько лет столицу Приморья уже восемь раз посещал «родственник» знаменитого лайнера – не менее знаменитый « Diamond Princess », относящийся к той же серии и принадлежащий той же корпорации. Еще одним важным событием 2016 г. стало первое посещение приморской столицы туристическим лайнером из КНР «Chinese Tais h an». Несмотря на то, что это не такой гигант, как «Sun Princess», и что рассчитан он на путешественников среднего достатка, прибытие «Chinese Tais h an» – знаменательное событие. Следует напомнить, что в связи с увеличением благосостояния китайские граждане приобрели к путешествиям особую страсть. Именно они сейчас составляют основу самых мощных и прибыльных туристических потоков. Есть все основания ожидать, что с каждым годом они будут расти, а новые морские туристические маршруты приобретут чрезвычайную популярность. Последним туристическим судном, посетившим Владивосток в 2016 г., стал « Pacific Venus », пришвартовавшийся в этом российском порту 20 октября. Он совершал круиз из Японии с заходом в южнокорейский порт Пусан. « Pacific Venus » входит в число крупнейших лайнеров Японского моря и является вторым по размеру японским кораблем. На его борту прибыло более 300 туристов. За последние несколько лет это уже пятое посещение « Pacific Venus » Владивостока. Еще одним результатом августовского визита приморского губернатора в КНР стало восстановление паромного сообщения по маршруту Сокчо (Южная Корея) – Зарубино (Россия) – Хуньчунь (Китай). Соответствующее трехстороннее соглашение было подписано на встрече губернаторов регионов стран СВА. С лета 2017 г. обновленная паромная линия будет перевозить больше туристов (будут использоваться суда вместимостью до 1000 человек) и значительные объемы грузов. Следует ожидать большого потока туристов: ведь в феврале 2016 г. Министерство культуры выдвинуло инициативу о включении Зарубино в число российских портов, для прибытия в которые иностранным туристам не потребуется виза. Давно известно, что туризм нельзя недооценивать. Помимо больших прибылей, которые он приносит сам по себе, он также способствует развитию международных культурных и торговых отношений. Туризм ведет к процветанию любого региона, обеспечивает рекламу, международный престиж и приток инвесторов. Что касается морских туристических маршрутов, то их прогресс неразрывно связан с развитием судоходства в целом.

Russians invaded Afghanistan, provided surface-to-air capability. nice give people train equip send fight ability defend themselves. one fundamental principles warfare understand it, said McCain.Soon statement, thousands US-made TOW Missiles smuggled Syria used terrorists groups command umbrella Al Nusra.In recent expos Trud Newspaper, Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva revealed massive scale scope illegal US-NATO weapons trafficking operation arm thousands terrorist fighters Syria.Despite overwhelming destruction Syria abject failure policies, McCain never given policy illegal weapons trafficking Syria. week, McCain, Chairman Senate Armed Services Committee, openly protested Trump Administration latest announcement bring end CIA failed program illegally arming training anti-Assad terrorists Syria. Rather admitting everyone else world seems know already US train equip program debacle instead feigns defiance, demonstrating breathtaking level ignorance accusing White House part Russian conspiracy: reports true, administration playing right hands Vladimir Putin. Making concession Russia, absent broader strategy Syria, irresponsible short-sighted. promoting latest war, McCain normally part tandem act, accompanied geomancing interest, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, arguably views world even deranged, albeit binary comic book prism: Breaking Syria apart Iran could important containing nuclear Iran sanctions. Syrian regime replaced another form government tie future Iranians, world better place. Like world view gleaned straight Ian Fleming Goldfinger.In seminal 2008 interview McCain heading GOP presidential nomination, Atlantic magazine Jeffrey Goldberg asked, think motivates Iran? . McCain replied: Hatred. try divine people motives. look actions say. pretend expert state emotions. know nation stated purpose is, know continue development nuclear weapons, know continue support terrorists bent destruction state Israel. ask someone engages psycho stuff talk emotions. McCain views Iraq even disturbing, essentially surmising invasion occupation good thing, left leaving Iraq gave rise al Qaeda. OK. Admittedly, bit counter intuitive, works neoconservatives.These statements McCain Graham admissions made normal well-adjusted individuals, rather cold, dark hearted sociopaths generally view lives Arabs (along Slavs, Russians others) necessary cannon fodder pursuit military industrial profits select cadr transnational corporate defense contractors whose interests Senator John McCain represents home state Arizona; Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, list goes on, on.The geopolitical hubris end there, McCain still maintains even 6 years absolute implosion foreign policy agenda removing Syrian President Bashar al Assad power still key pillar US strategy Syria. administration yet articulate vision Syria beyond defeat ISIL, let alone comprehensive approach Middle East, said McCain week.The reality, course, ISIL/ISIS could defeated already US-led Coalition Israel illegally intervened Syria territory. Far much defeat ISIS since invaded Syrian airspace since 2014, US conveniently stretched-out ISIS problem extension self-styled international mandate originally intended serve precursor eventual break-up Syria federal states ethnic cantons. might explain McCain rush enact regime change Syria lording eventual break-up sovereign nation-state.All Things RussianThe country McCain determined break Russia. Vladimir Putin murder KGB thug, crowed McCain CNN last year, protested positive statements Russia made candidate Trump.Suffice say, he, along boards Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, extremely happy NATO pressing right Russian border eastern Europe.But 2013 indeed busy year Senator stirring trouble internationally. part opening gambit Moscow, McCain driving force behind US-backed coup etat Ukraine February 2014 ultimately led bloody civil war continues day Ukraine. Apparently, McCain way stopping Putin. dodgy track record; whether NeoNazis, Jihadi Terrorists, McCain seems always ready deal devil, makes particularly dangerous.Below see McCain helping whip-up Nazi-linked, neofascist street mobs Kiev helping bring ensuing junta power. mainstream US pundits claimed never happened, conspiracy theory invented Russian propagandists discredit McCain. Unfortunately true, photo prove it:Senator John McCain (AZ) shares stage Kiev far-right, NeoNazi Right Sector strongman, Oleg Tyhanbock, ahead violent street protests Ukraine December 2013, advance US-backed coup.. Looking back erratic flippant behavior, attacking nearly anyone even suggested tente Russia supplying lethal arms militants Syria bad idea, surprise cognizant onlookers questioned whether McCain normal frame mind.Frankly speaking, could one right mind consistently wrong side every issue? could politician judgement poor? Unless something else going surface questions stop there. McCain performance recent Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing Russian Influence US Elections embarrassment. Onlookers stunned McCain lost plot hearing asking former FBI Director James Comey: Well, least minds member, whole lot questions remaining went on, particularly considering fact mentioned, big deal went campaign, glad concluded part investigation, think American people whole lot questions there, particularly since emphasized role Russia played. obviously candidate president time. clearly involved whole situation fake news, described it, big deal took place. going help here. words, complete, investigation anything former Secretary Clinton campaign worry anymore?

Strange might sound some, consider members ruling elite mandarin management class, perfectly acceptable quid pro quo 2017.After World War II, military industrial complex international arms trade spread conflict like disease across planet, metastasizing ways, places, scale one could previously imagined before.

1346,"Tweet Home » Gold » Gold News » Here’s PROOF Gold Price Based Cost, Supply Demand Gold’s true value based cost production, rather it’s high-quality store value basis money global economy. reason value gold skyrocket going forward quite simple: SRSRocco : notion gold price based economics “Supply & Demand” turns incorrect cost production leading factor. also true commodities energy. Unfortunately, economists analysts precious metals community continue believe economic principle supply demand determines price. look data provided article, individual see closely related cost gold production spot price. said, information article show “commodity pricing mechanism” gold, true store value. There’s big difference 99% Mainstream media understand… probably good percentage precious metals community well. Top Two Gold Miners Cost Production vs. Gold Price decided take data top two gold miners, Barrick Newmont, exercise largest two gold producers world. Yes, could spent several days compiling data top 20 gold miners, don’t luxury paid financial institution analysis. Regardless, Barrick Newmont provide good representation cost producing gold entire industry. According “Adjusted Income Approach” determining full cost production, constructed chart below. One thing included adjusted income approach dividend payouts. included total cost per ounce Barrick Newmont: see price gold increased past 15 years, cost production top two gold miners. 2000, total average cost produce gold Barrick Newmont $243 versus spot price $279. Thus, average profit margin 13% gold mining companies year. average price gold surged record $1,669 2012, average cost produce yellow metal Barrick Newmont increased $1,386 . Yes, it’s true two gold miners enjoyed 17% profit margin year, wrong that?? Companies must profits pay new projects, shareholder dividends surplus cash lean years losses incurred. compare increase gold price 2000 2012 versus cost production, see interesting similar trend: Gold Price Increase vs Cost Production 2000-2012 Gold Price Increase 2000 – 2012 = 498% Gold Cost Increase 2000 – 2012 = 470% average gold spot price increased 498% 2000-2012, cost production Barrick Newmont jumped 470%. put another way, difference increased cost production (470%) average spot price (498%) 2000-2012 time period, lousy 6%. gold mining industry deserve paltry 6% profit margin time period?? means… economists throw window worthless principle supply demand. So, cost gold production increase much since 2000?? Could anything increased cost energy?? Well, yes did. wrote previous article, Analysts’s Gold & Silver Forecasts Wrong . article, show price barrel oil increased $20 2000 $112 2012. Thus, gold cost production increased nearly five times back five times increase price oil time period. Now, look data 2015, top two gold miners profit margin fell 3.8% cost per ounce $1,116 compared $1,160 spot price. reason cost production declined 2015 versus 2012, due oil price (as well energy inputs) falling 50%. Okay, imagine many reading article would wonder stated gold price skyrocket future price oil collapses towards $12 2020. doesn’t make sense lower energy price would also dictate lower cost production… hence gold spot price fall well. stated beginning article, information pertains “commodity pricing mechanism” gold, true “high-quality store value.” Gold silver (to lesser extent) commodities, rather function money stores wealth. much different way attribute value precious metals cost production. touch end article, information cost gold production need understand first. Gold Cost Production Understated Due Massive Share Dilution Increased Debt gold cost production Barrick Newmont understated due massive amount share dilution increased debt. First, let’s look change outstanding shares two gold mining companies: Barrick Newmont’s outstanding shares tripled 526 million 2000 1,695 million (1.69 billion) shares 2015. Basically, two gold mining companies could afford expand production surplus profits. Instead, resorted issuing shares purchase new gold mines fund new projects. means, shareholder took burden increased cost expanded production. hard put figure much higher cost produce gold would shareholder used fund activity, safely assume would higher today. Secondly, total liabilities two companies surged $32.9 billion 2015 versus $3.8 billion 2000: see Barrick Newmont’s total liabilities nearly ten times higher 2000. course, readers say companies expanded production increased gold projects also increased total assets. Yes, true… but, look net increase gold production since 2000, something seems wrong here: net result increased gold production Barrick Newmont since 2000, turns 1.7 million oz, 17%. Even though two companies enjoyed higher production past years, produced 17% gold 2015 2000. means, lot new projects used offset declines shut-downs mining operations. clearly see data above, two gold miners cost production would higher shareholder dilution increased debt removed equation. Cost Gold Production It’s True Store Value data proves mining industry used shareholder debt increase artificially lower true cost producing gold, ultimate methodology value gold. Gold’s true value based cost production, rather it’s high-quality store value basis money global economy. reason value gold skyrocket going forward quite simple. world bamboozled Wall Street, Central Banks financial media put 99% investment funds Stocks, Bonds Real Estate. oil production consumption increased past, allowed Global GDP net worth grow.
